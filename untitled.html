This explains the human beings came from one father, Adam. The human genome is manipulated during the synch cycle of both genetics and past time and thus emerges inherited traits. Therefore, the production or emergence of acquired genetic traits play a guiding role in the individual's behavior, that resemble to those of the role of genetic traits — which were in ancient centuries. The past time revolves around two points one cycle, every few centuries. Genetic traits are transmitted with certain pathological complications.\end{summary}</div><div></div><div></div><div>\section{Introduction}</div><div>When one of the children was infected with respiratory infection, he had a strange behavior, while awake and sleeping, so he acted as if the ghost was chasing him and sometimes screaming for fear of a frightening vision of dreams, which turned out to be the same dreams that his father had in the past, unlike the rest of his brothers . This is a motive for the search for the history of his predecessors, where I found that one of his parents had suffered from the same symptoms at some point in the past. There were also some behavioral traits in the male child, who was born before the female child who had visual symptoms. As if the genetic traits passed from parents to children in a time sequence and based on positioning. Both children's grandparents did not have these traits.</div><div>Why do people make revolutionary changes such as wars and scientific revolutions only in certain stages?</div><div>Is it possible that successive genetic processes occur to produce genetic traits from non-parents?</div><div>Can we avoid the downside of future events?</div><div>\subsection{Hypothesis}</div><div></div><div>1. Chromosomes are linked together according to the similarity of quantum accumulation between their genome, and therefore, chromosomal disintegration may occur due to the genome variation of tow chromatids, that were identical in interstitial phase.</div><div>2. The acquired genetic traits are cyclical, thus the modifications (changes) that organisms acquire during their lifetime are periodically transmitted by inheritance.</div><div>3. Evolution comes through the emergence of genetic traits in living organisms according to a adaptive synchronization with time - since man began as a giant, and eventually turns to dwarfism.</div><div>4. The future tense written previously as well as the revolutions of the past tense also has a cycle every few centuries, thus, the present tense is merely quantum relative between them, moreover, we can avoid the disadvantages of the future.</div><div>5. When correlations occur between physical objects, a quantum entanglements are formed, through which the effects are exchanged, and this is the ether.</div><div>6. Both males and females are bisexual-like in quantum proportions and can therefore be modified to show some common physical properties between them, and thus, a woman just as a quantum chromosome donor and a man just as a quantum chromosome acceptor, and vis versa.</div><div>7. Pica during pregnancy, a woman may experience the crave for lust for someone other than her husband. This may play a role in changing the genome of her fetus. Thus, there is a possibility that the traits of the child's genetics will be similar to that of a man who is desired by mother of child.</div><div></div><div>\section{Acquire genetic traits by interaction}</div><div>Some genetic traits acquired into the embryo (in the initial stages of formation) have been added, which are likely to appear at some stage as a result of a particular arousal, and may acquire hereditary traits during his lifetime. The creature benefits from these genetic traits as a means of survival and adaptation, etc. These genetic traits are either structural or change in structure only in terms of height, shortness and width (no change in the DNA chain) or axioms, which are found in different proportions among humans such as science and disease, so-called differentiation between creatures. Some creatures have specific genetic traits that are included in the coding of the gene and then move to the offspring, while others do not acquire it. Through the structure of the formation in the form of entanglement ring, so the structure of the creature (animal or human) may be prolonged or shrinking due to daily practices and due to adaptation to environmental conditions, but did not come as a result of evolution from one creature to another, as it was claimed that “humans came from the monkey”. This is due to the denatured which altered the sequence of human DNA and then was distilled into the monkey. Finally, any genetic change that occurs to parents will become a genetic trait acquired by the children. “STEC belonging to serogroups O26,O103, and O111 were characterized to determine clonality and to profile virulence traits”&nbsp; ( class="Itx_cote" data-bib-text="@articale{Schmidt, Herbert, et al. 1999,</div><div>Doi= {<a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/314537">https://doi.org/10.1086/314537</a>},</div><div>Url = {<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/179/1/115/877122/Non-O157-H7-Pathogenic-Shiga-Toxin-Producing">https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/179/1/115/877122/Non-O157-H7-Pathogenic-Shiga-Toxin-Producing</a>},</div><div>Year = {1999},</div><div>month = {January},</div><div>Publisher = {JID},</div><div>Volume = {179},</div><div>Number = {1},</div><div>Pages = {115--123},</div><div>Author = {Schmidt, H., Geitz, C., Tarr, P.

The individual also acquires genetic traits through mutual influence with others around him. Thus, when a person contacts friends who use drugs, his behavior is affected by the passing of a response to quantum emissions from their hearts, which receive a response from his heart and then become part of his genome and therefore, plays a guiding and stimulating role that directs that individual to take drugs and so on. Genetic traits have been programmed in advance to appear periodically and are suitable for the future as well as showing the traits of the effects appeared in the past to come back and affect the behavior of humans in the future – and recognize this during the similarity of the results that led to those behaviors. “The D allele of the ACE gene is equally prevalent among African Americans and whites and may be related to venous thrombosis among African-American men” class="Itx_cote" data-bib-text="@articale{Dilley, Anne, et al.

Thus, inherited traits that affect the lives of individuals either as a means of survival and facilitating the affairs of life, or a familiarity that brings unhappiness and misery. Therefore, the emergence of such genetic traits is subject to several factors, such as according to the individual's own decision because he or she has the ability to choose as above or have already been added by God, as well as genetic traits that maintain offspring (such as the structure and sequence of DNA of organisms) which no object can modify or delete it. “Epistasis—nonlinear genetic interactions between polymorphic loci—is the genetic basis of canalization and speciation, and epistatic interactions can be used to infer genetic networks affecting quantitative traits” ( class="Itx_cote" data-bib-text="@articale{Huang, Wen, et al. 2012),</div><div>Doi= {10.1073/pnas.1213423109},</div><div>Url = {<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.cm10313">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.cm10313</a>},</div><div>Year = {2012},</div><div>Month = {September},</div><div>Publisher = {PANS},</div><div>Volume = {109},</div><div>Number = {38},</div><div>Pages = {15553--15559},</div><div>Author = {Wen Huanga,</div><div>Stephen Richardsb,</div><div>Mary Anna Carbonea,</div><div>Dianhui Zhub,</div><div>Robert R.

Thus, interactions occur during a fracture structure coupled with an acoustic fingerprint that plays a role in genetic modification, and then to become as acquired genetic trait.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>\section{Method}</div><div>Based on observation, experimentation and conclusion, by examining the behavior of individuals for a long time and the mechanism of their awareness as well as genetic diseases that arise in children, although not familiar with those events, which was in the era of parents. As well as the assumptions to solve some genetic issues, especially the theory of evolution that developed by Darwin.</div><div></div><div>\section{Conclusions}</div><div>Chromosomes are linked together according to the similarity of quantum accumulation between their genome, and therefore, chromosomal disintegration may occur due to the genome variation of tow chromatids, that were identical in interstitial phase.</div><div>Also, both the couple's chromatids (men and women), which are linked according to quanta similarity between their genetic material, may be separated due to the separation of one chromatid from the other, and thus the family disintegrates. Furthermore, both husband and wife are as chromosome, which consists of two chromatids, that are identical in the genetic material (which appears as an affinity between them). Therefore, the coupling genes of our DNA have been timed in advance too.</div><div>Gravity is therefore the ability to form an associative affinity through quantitative cognition between two objects to make a identical ratios between their different genetic material. It is also a branch of stereochemistry, especially isomerism, and therefore it takes a certain isomer structure due to the mechanism of interconnections between the objects. Which means the forces of time influence between objects.</div><div>Thus, the force of gravitational are also exchanged between two identical objects, where the first part leaves quantities of the gravitation, and a similar quantities of the gravitation is left by the second body. The first part relates to the location of the second part on the second body, and the second is related to the first place. As a result, there is a mutual effect between two objects. Moreover, the gravitational does not depend on mass, but rather on the quantum accumulation of the genetic material.</div><div>Heart's optional electromagnetism in which double-polar quantum magnets direct their magnetic field toward a specific external magnetic field. The direction of the magnetic field depends on the field strength of an internal quantum magnet — not on the strength of the external magnetic field. While less quantities oriented towards the external magnetic field — the higher quantities are shown as contrast and opposite direction of that external magnetic field, and so on. That is, the field of heart's magnetic changes due to the direction of the higher cumulative quantum field of intrenal-magnets, which changes its direction towards a vector that opposes the external magnetic field. Moreover, the heart has opposite internal magnets, that depending on the quantum quantities. Thus, one of these magnets have optional electromagnetism to direct its field&nbsp; toward any external magnetic field — whether it is a high or weak field. The magnetic field of the heart is directly proportional to the quantum quantities. Therefore, the higher the amount of quantum inside the heart, the stronger the magnetic field, and thus leads to the direction of the magnetic field which compatible with it. This is like a logical debate between the magnets of the heart. And also, the magnetic isomerism of the heart are affected by the presence of an external radio field so that the movements of vibrational radio waves work on the distribution of quantum magnetism in a certain direction. For example, one of the magnets distributes a plasmodium arrangement, while other magnets take a correlated ranking and become more solid (hardened). Furthermore, every acoustic coding suitable for cardiac magnetism will affect the genetic characteristics and also when choosing between two things, depends on the anterior lobe of the brain, due to feedback in advance, to give rejection or acceptance. In terms of social relationships, that fall within involuntary commands depend on the heart, so when the success of recognition between two hearts leads to the formation of a coalition affinity, and if there is a contradiction, will lead to forces of repulsion (disaccord). Therefore, we find that man remains stable on the surface of the Earth other than the surface of the moon — because the disaccord of correlation between their molecules.</div><div>In addition, as for inherited traits, all humans and animals are genetically influenced by everything that happens around them whether the environment or any other object, depending on the eye's effect (e.g., when they are affected by someabilities, etc.) They will acquire similar genetic traits. This is in line with what Darwin's opinion. Where the length of the giraffe's neck was not as self-evolution — it evolved according to emerge of the genetic traits, that previously included in its genome, as adaptive simultaneous to function of time, while showing the periodicity of&nbsp; genetic traits (germplasma), and therefore organism adapted to the environment (future conditions) as well as the means of survival. Moreover, evolution comes through the emergence of genetic traits in living organisms that synchronically with the function of time — since man began as a giant, they will gradually end up dwarfing.</div><div>As for compulsive effect of physical and sexual characteristics (e.g., masculinity) between males and females according to genetic energy emissions, (through observation for some families).</div><div>Genetic modification is performed through the emission of quantum energy between male and female (which is similar to oxidation-reductase interaction). A woman just as a quantum chromosome donor and a man just as a quantum chromosome acceptor, and vis versa. Moreover, both male and female traits are mutually transmitted, and men may acquire Characteristics of women, and thus change the characteristics of women as well.</div><div>The energy is exchanged through oxidation-reduction reactions, between physiological traits of male and female according to quantum genetic encodings, that their influence settles in certain nerve-entanglement and also affects the individual's behavior. Thus, they are only relative reduction — not quite a holistic effect.</div><div>Women who have a positive effect on male's physical characteristics will not affect the characteristics of their children or husbands — unlike some of them who have a negative effect and therefore, influence the physical characteristics of their children and husband, “iff” both do not know about the processes of that energy or its source, otherwise it is possible to invalidate this effect if known its source. As opposed to behavioral influence among males and each other, which plays a directional role — while the influence between male and female plays an adaptive role in reduction the physical and sexual characteristics of each other (quantitatively). Where these processes depend on the density of quantum charges. Thus, human as a radioactive chemical element. And there is associative affinity (like the co-enzyme), where it plays tuning role in the energy between two bodies, (e.g., between husband and his wife, etc) for the occurrence of an associative reaction, Just as colonization of genetic expression, (quanta-energy encoding), that settles in the one of entanglements.</div><div>It is impossible to marry a man from a woman, unless the genetic material (in the arms of the isomer structure of their hearts) is identical; to synthesize the field of internal magnetism, as well as to match the angles of entanglement and rotation of rings according to fractal bond, otherwise there will be no coupling — that affinity is responsible for enabling quantum ratios between threads. These encodings are subject to several processes through the heart, tongue and eye, where they are loaded with a specific audio codec, and structure to match the structure of the receiving end.</div><div>Moreover, the forces that are exchanged between two quantum entanglements or two objects remain within the ether.</div><div>According to the influence of gravity between two physical objects, so both the passage of time rapidly (time contraction) or the passage of time slowly (time extension) are not merely a phantom feeling, but as a result of mutual influence between two objects, and therefore it proves the multiple universes, and at the same time, prove the eligibility of time.</div><div>It also seems that the human structure is characterized by the ability to evolution, as well as the genetic differentiation that arises from some, which is a gift from God (added during the formation of embryos), to help them facilitate their way of life as well to fit with the environment in which they will live and to determine their livelihoods such as science and happiness And so on. Genetics in humans have also been programmed according to the relapse function (decreasing over time). Moreover, the height of the individual (the characteristic of man in the deep past), will gradually decrease (synchronously with time), until it reaches dwarfism. Some of the genetic traits such as height (that have helped to survive and adapt old humans) have been replaced by inherited traits that have contributed to the invention of the machine. Therefore, it is evidence of the periodicity of genetics traits that are synchronized with time, and that the future has been already written. Moreover, humanity passes through a pre-programmed plan to match the growth of the universe to its end. Genetics traits are associated with a quantum percentage of other traits as a result of a certain coding (consisting of an acoustic wavelength, such as the individual's own sound signal) that is accepted through genetic modification, and hence acquired genetic traits emerge. "Pica" during hunger, such as feeling a desire for something, or being amazed at the beauty of someone may cause the emission of radiation from eyes and heart, that leads to genetic modification in the cell and may lead to a cancerous mutation. These rays have an associative property where they have the ability to pair and modify. This is similar to what happens during pregnancy and when a woman is exposed to pica (craving for some food during pregnancy, etc).</div><div>\end{document}</div>
