This explains the human beings came from one father, Adam. The human genome is manipulated during the synch cycle of both genetics and past time and thus emerges inherited traits. Therefore, the production or emergence of acquired genetic traits play a guiding role in the individual's behavior, that resemble to those of the role of genetic traits — which were in ancient centuries. The past time revolves around two points one cycle, every few centuries. Genetic traits are transmitted with certain pathological complications.\end{summary}</div><div></div><div></div><div>\section{Introduction}</div><div>When one of the children was infected with respiratory infection, he had a strange behavior, while awake and sleeping, so he acted as if the ghost was chasing him and sometimes screaming for fear of a frightening vision of dreams, which turned out to be the same dreams that his father had in the past, unlike the rest of his brothers . This is a motive for the search for the history of his predecessors, where I found that one of his parents had suffered from the same symptoms at some point in the past. There were also some behavioral traits in the male child, who was born before the female child who had visual symptoms. As if the genetic traits passed from parents to children in a time sequence and based on positioning. Both children's grandparents did not have these traits.</div><div>Why do people make revolutionary changes such as wars and scientific revolutions only in certain stages?</div><div>Is it possible that successive genetic processes occur to produce genetic traits from non-parents?</div><div>Can we avoid the downside of future events?</div><div>\subsection{Hypotheses}</div><div>1. There are recessive genetic traits that emergence only when they are associated (linkage) with anther complementary genetic traits.</div><div>2. The possibility of a chromosome has the ability to correlate with a complementary ( Couple-characters) and moreover, a certain genetic trait emerges in the genome.</div><div>3. Neurological and psychological diseases are directly proportional to genetic evolution.</div><div>4. The acquired genetic traits are cyclical.</div><div>5. The modifications (changes) that organisms acquire during their lifetime are periodically transmitted by inheritance.</div><div>6. Human genetics characteristics have a reversible exponential growth function (decreasing). Since humanity began as giants, so it will lead to dwarfism.</div><div>7. The future tense written previously as well as the revolutions of the past tense also has a cycle every few centuries, thus, the present tense is merely a relative quantum between them, moreover, we can avoid the disadvantages of the future.</div><div>8. The human gene is characterized by differentiation and modification.</div><div>9. Both males and females are bisexual-like in quantum proportions and can therefore be modified to show some common physical properties between them.</div><div>10. Pica during pregnancy, a woman may experience the crave for lust for someone other than her husband. This may play a role in changing the gene. There is a possibility that the traits of the child's genetics will be similar to that of a man who is desired by a woman (genetically modified).</div><div></div><div>\section{Acquire genetic traits by interaction}</div><div>Some genetic traits acquired into the embryo (in the initial stages of formation) have been added, which are likely to appear at some stage as a result of a particular arousal, and may acquire hereditary traits during his lifetime. The creature benefits from these genetic traits as a means of survival and adaptation, etc. These genetic traits are either structural or change in structure only in terms of height, shortness and width (no change in the DNA chain) or axioms, which are found in different proportions among humans such as science and disease, so-called differentiation between creatures. Some creatures have specific genetic traits that are included in the coding of the gene and then move to the offspring, while others do not acquire it. Through the structure of the formation in the form of entanglement ring, so the structure of the creature (animal or human) may be prolonged or shrinking due to daily practices and due to adaptation to environmental conditions, but did not come as a result of evolution from one creature to another, as it was claimed that “humans came from the monkey”. This is due to the denatured which altered the sequence of human DNA and then was distilled into the monkey. Finally, any genetic change that occurs to parents will become a genetic trait acquired by the children. “STEC belonging to serogroups O26,O103, and O111 were characterized to determine clonality and to profile virulence traits”&nbsp; (&lt;cite class="Itx_cote" data-bib-text="@articale{Schmidt, Herbert, et al. 1999,</div><div>Doi= {<a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/314537">https://doi.org/10.1086/314537</a>},</div><div>Url = {<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/179/1/115/877122/Non-O157-H7-Pathogenic-Shiga-Toxin-Producing">https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/179/1/115/877122/Non-O157-H7-Pathogenic-Shiga-Toxin-Producing</a>},</div><div>Year = {1999},</div><div>month = {January},</div><div>Publisher = {JID},</div><div>Volume = {179},</div><div>Number = {1},</div><div>Pages = {115--123},</div><div>Author = {Schmidt, H., Geitz, C., Tarr, P.

The individual also acquires genetic traits through mutual influence with others around him. Thus, when a person contacts friends who use drugs, his behavior is affected by the passing of a response to quantum emissions from their hearts, which receive a response from his heart and then become part of his genome and therefore, plays a guiding and stimulating role that directs that individual to take drugs and so on. Genetic traits have been programmed in advance to appear periodically and are suitable for the future as well as showing the traits of the effects appeared in the past to come back and affect the behavior of humans in the future – and recognize this during the similarity of the results that led to those behaviors. “The D allele of the ACE gene is equally prevalent among African Americans and whites and may be related to venous thrombosis among African-American men”&lt;cite class="Itx_cote" data-bib-text="@articale{Dilley, Anne, et al.

Thus, inherited traits that affect the lives of individuals either as a means of survival and facilitating the affairs of life, or a familiarity that brings unhappiness and misery. Therefore, the emergence of such genetic traits is subject to several factors, such as according to the individual's own decision because he or she has the ability to choose as above or have already been added by God, as well as genetic traits that maintain offspring (such as the structure and sequence of DNA of organisms) which no object can modify or delete it. “Epistasis—nonlinear genetic interactions between polymorphic loci—is the genetic basis of canalization and speciation, and epistatic interactions can be used to infer genetic networks affecting quantitative traits” (&lt;cite class="Itx_cote" data-bib-text="@articale{Huang, Wen, et al. 2012),</div><div>Doi= {10.1073/pnas.1213423109},</div><div>Url = {<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.cm10313">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.cm10313</a>},</div><div>Year = {2012},</div><div>Month = {September},</div><div>Publisher = {PANS},</div><div>Volume = {109},</div><div>Number = {38},</div><div>Pages = {15553--15559},</div><div>Author = {Wen Huanga,</div><div>Stephen Richardsb,</div><div>Mary Anna Carbonea,</div><div>Dianhui Zhub,</div><div>Robert R.

Thus, interactions occur during a fracture structure coupled with an acoustic fingerprint that plays a role in genetic modification, and then to become as acquired genetic trait.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>\section{Method}</div><div>Observation of the symptoms of disease in children, (a girl aged 4 years, boys aged 8 years) when suffering from acute pulmonary infections. This child has a connected lobe (dominant character) from her father.</div><div></div><div></div><div>\section{Conclusions}</div><div>Through observation I find that genetic traits, it moves or emerges through several methods such as if one of the chromosomes is ready for association with a complementary, albeit non-parent.</div><div>That is, some genetic traits have one genetic factor either from the father or from the mother, according to quantum ratio.</div><div>The genetic factor is combined with another complement in the formation of male or female gametes. This means that several factors can be shared in the acquired genetic trait. Therefore, the behavior of the children changes as a result of that genetic quantum, which plays a guiding role and an electromagnetic&nbsp; affinity in the behavior of the children.</div><div>Therefore, acquired traits are included in the genetic code that passes from person to person. For this, there are no pure genetic traits. Thus, these genetic traits do not occur according to modifications in the DNA chain, but by cellular differentiation.</div><div>The symptoms associated with the disease (which were then infected by the parents) are a hybrid genetic trait, resulting from sequential processes which are then periodically transmitted to re-emerge in the genome of a child. For this reason, the disease also affects the visual system, leading to visual editing (genetic illusion). Therefore, these symptoms are not normal, but due to the emergence of recessive genetic traits.</div><div>In other words, these visual fantasies (which seen by the child) are not the result of pre-stored biological information, but because of the genes the child has acquired from his or her parents or those that came from sequential processes (complementary). Wherefore, children acquire inherited traits, associated with certain diseases. Therefore, the effect of viruses has a direct effect, depends on the evolution of the child's gene, which plays a role in manipulating the dimensions of vision as well as visual editing, such as dream during sleep. Thus, their symptoms of the diseases emerge, at certain stages and in special circumstances. These symptoms are at the peak of their activity at night by controlling the pathways of sight, so that viruses find the sleep period is an ideal period to start working, because their ability to synthesize dreams, that synchronized with the night — which in turn affects the measurement of both angle and placement of the eyes (during sleep).</div><div>Acquired genetic characteristics remain in the state of latency, only if raised by an effect. Moreover, a linkage is created between both the child's chromosome and the other complementary, for to produce those pathological complications. These symptoms, which emerge in children of a certain age, will not continue or remain as a syndrome, but its will be to become cognitive abilities — when they reach a certain age. Thus, that phenomenon occurs only at the beginning of the stage of the synthesis and evolution of the gene, because they have been exposed to such infections, without the emergence of those symptoms. Furthermore, genetics take a state of genetic entanglement, and through it a genetic factor is associated with a complementary, to emerge recessive genetic traits as well as some behavioral traits have emerged in humans in the past centuries, which prompted them to act like revolutions, etc. And then, (after a period of time ago), these genetic traits are reintroduced as a result of successive processes between the genetic traits and the cycle of time — which consists of quantum effects as a complementary, of the genetic factor, to produce certain genetic traits (General Genetic Characteristics). This is similar to the behaviors resulting from common and periodic genetic traits that are passed down through generations and play a role in changing living systems and geography. That is why all human beings came from one father, Adam.</div><div>It also seems that the human structure is characterized by the ability to evolution, as well as the genetic differentiation that arises from some, which is a gift from God (added during the formation of embryos), to help them facilitate their way of life as well to fit with the environment in which they will live and to determine their livelihoods such as science and happiness And so on. Genetics in humans have also been programmed according to the relapse function (decreasing over time). Moreover, the height of the individual (the characteristic of man in the deep past), will gradually decrease (synchronously with time), until it reaches dwarfism. Some of the genetic traits such as height (that have helped to survive and adapt old humans) have been replaced by inherited traits that have contributed to the invention of the machine. Therefore, it is evidence of the periodicity of genetics traits that are synchronized with time, and that the future has been already written. Moreover, humanity passes through a pre-programmed plan to match the growth of the universe to its end. Genetics traits are associated with a quantum percentage of other traits as a result of a certain coding (consisting of an acoustic wavelength, such as the individual's own sound signal) that is accepted through genetic modification, and hence acquired genetic traits emerge. "Pica" during hunger, such as feeling a desire for something, or being amazed at the beauty of someone may cause the emission of radiation from eyes and heart, that leads to genetic modification in the cell and may lead to a cancerous mutation. These rays have an associative property where they have the ability to pair and modify. This is similar to what happens during pregnancy and when a woman is exposed to pica (craving for some food during pregnancy, etc).</div><div>\end{document}</div>
